Using `sby`
===========

Once SBY is installed and available on the command line as `sby`, either built from source or using
one of the available CAD suites, it can be called as follows.  Note that this information is also
available via `sby --help`.  For more information on installation, see :ref:`install-doc`.

.. argparse::
    :module: sby_cmdline
    :func: parser_func
    :prog: sby
